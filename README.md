# rock_paper_scissor-v1.1
An updated version of the base program I published earlier.
This particular program has a lot of moving parts.
I added a few features from the existing program I coded from scratch earlier:
  + Ability to play the game for more than one round 
  + Varied computer/user responses for when they win/lose the game (can be customized to user's liking)
  + Ability to exit the game once the player feels that they've played enough

I am aware that some parts of the code did not utilize proper use of python for/while loops and I apologize for that.
I know that the code is a bit messy and I am working to fix it

Code is open source feel free to use but don't forget to include me in the credits

Code is created from scratch by Christopher Andrew
